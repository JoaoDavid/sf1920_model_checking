/*
absence_of_starvation

Within the source file directory, execute the following commands

spin -a PrintingSystem.pml
gcc -O2 -o pan pan.c
pan -a -f

(-a enables search for acceptance cyles)
(-f enables fairness mode)

If the property was violated, the following message will show up
pan: acceptance cycle (at depth _)
Since this is a liveness property (something good eventually happens)
a counter example is an inÔ¨Ånite computation in which something good never happens, in this case, the client is never served

If the property holds, the message pan: acceptance cycle (at depth _) will not be shown

In order to intentionally violate this property, comment the line of code:
served[_pid % NUM_OF_CLIENTS] = true;
This line of code states the client has been served, after he has sent all the pages to the printer that accepted his request. If commented, simulates the client never being served (starvation)
